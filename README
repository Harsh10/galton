Galton : estimate with confidence

Galton provides a simple interface to calculate confidence curves for risk-based estimatation.

A project consists of any number of tasks. Each task has a description, an estimate of effort, and a risk (low, medium, high).
Galton runs a monte carlo simulation on the tasks to derive a probability distribution of possible outcomes, then displays the 
confidence curve (CDF - cumulative distribution function) and related statistics.

Galton depends on these python packages:
 * web.py
 * numpy
 
The data migration scripts depend on:
 * sqlalchemy
 * sqlalchemy-migrate
